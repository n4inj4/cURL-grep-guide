## üîó cURL (Client URL) Command

`curl` is a powerful command-line tool used for transferring data to and from servers. It supports various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It is widely used for interacting with web APIs, downloading files, or even making requests to websites.

### üìñ What can you do with `curl`?
- **Download files** from the web.
- **Send data** to a server (e.g., for API testing).
- **Access APIs** with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.
- **Upload files** to a remote server.
- **Follow redirects** and manage cookies automatically.

  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my-token" https://api.example.com/data
  ```
  This sends a request with an authentication token in the header.

## üîç Grep Command

`grep` is a powerful command-line utility used for searching text within files or command outputs. It supports regular expressions and is highly useful for filtering results based on patterns.

### üìñ What can you do with `grep`?
- **Search for text patterns** within files or outputs.
- **Filter logs** for specific keywords.
- **Highlight specific patterns** within files.
- **Combine it with other commands** like `ls`, `cat`, or `curl` to refine results.

### üìã Grep Options Table

| **Option**           | **Description**                                                                                          | **Example**                                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `-i, --ignore-case`   | Perform case-insensitive matching.                                                                        | `grep -i "error" file.txt`                     |
| `-r, --recursive`     | Search recursively through directories.                                                                   | `grep -r "TODO" /path/to/project`              |
| `-v, --invert-match`  | Invert match to show lines that don't contain the pattern.                                                | `grep -v "DEBUG" log.txt`                      |
| `-c, --count`         | Display the count of matching lines.                                                                      | `grep -c "error" log.txt`                      |
| `-n, --line-number`   | Show line numbers with matching lines.                                                                    | `grep -n "main" file.c`                        |
| `-o, --only-matching` | Print only the matched parts of a line.                                                                   | `grep -o "https://[a-z]*" file.txt`            |
| `-l, --files-with-matches` | List files containing matches.                                                                      | `grep -l "TODO" *.txt`                         |
| `--color`             | Highlight matches in the output.                                                                          | `grep --color "error" log.txt`                 |

### üìù Examples

- **Search for a word in a file**:
  ```bash
  grep "hello" file.txt
  ```
  This finds all lines containing the word "hello" in `file.txt`.

- **Case-insensitive search**:
  ```bash
  grep -i "error" log.txt
  ```
  This searches for the word "error" in a case-insensitive manner.

- **Recursive search in a directory**:
  ```bash
  grep -r "TODO" /path/to/project
  ```
  This searches for the keyword "TODO" in all files within a project directory.

- **Find lines without a keyword**:
  ```bash
  grep -v "DEBUG" log.txt
  ```
  This finds all lines in `log.txt` that do NOT contain the word "DEBUG".

- **Show only matching parts of a line**:
  ```bash
  grep -o "https://[a-z]*" file.txt
  ```
  This extracts all URLs starting with `https://` from a text file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Combining cURL & Grep

`curl` and `grep` can be used together to retrieve data and filter the output. Here's an example:

### Example: Fetching and Searching API Data

```bash
curl https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts | grep "userId"
```

This command fetches a list of posts and then filters only the lines that contain `userId`.

Another useful case is to download web content and search for specific patterns:

### Example: Download a webpage and search for a keyword

```bash
curl https://example.com -s | grep -i "privacy"
```

This command silently fetches the contents of a webpage and searches for the word "privacy" (case-insensitive).

## üìö Conclusion

`curl` and `grep` are extremely powerful and flexible tools. Whether you're downloading files, making API requests, or searching through logs and files, these commands have you covered! üöÄ

Explore more possibilities by combining them with other commands to build complex data pipelines. Happy hacking! üòé
